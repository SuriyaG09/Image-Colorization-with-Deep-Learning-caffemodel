# Image Colorization with Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the process of colorizing grayscale images using a pre-trained deep neural network model and OpenCV. The script takes an input grayscale image, processes it through the colorization model, and displays both the original grayscale image and the colorized version.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
